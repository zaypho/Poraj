#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

(3) POST /chats/{cid}/messages/{mid}/save {kind:'saved'|'practice'} toggles the message into the user's saved_by/practice_by array (returns {ok, kind, active}). (4) GET /chats/saved/list?kind=saved|practice returns the user's saved/practice messages across conversations. (5) POST /chats/{cid}/messages/{mid}/correction {corrected, note?} attaches manual_correction {corrected, note, by, by_name, at} to a message (notifies partner). (6) DELETE /chats/{cid}/messages/{mid}/correction removes it. (7) POST /chats/{cid}/messages/delete {ids:[...]} bulk-deletes selected messages in the conversation. message_public now returns pinned, manual_correction, transcript, saved_by, practice_by. Please test with mei@demo.com / Demo1234! and diego@demo.com / Demo1234!: create a conversation (POST /chats {partner_id}), send a message, then verify each endpoint incl. toggle on/off behaviour, saved list membership, correction set/remove, bulk delete removes messages, and 404 for bad ids, 404/403 for foreign conversation."

## Test Run — Phase 3: Free WebRTC video classroom for Pro
user_problem_statement: Build the Pro video class with WebRTC — free, no API keys. If not possible, drop video. (Implemented free P2P WebRTC: Google STUN + our own FastAPI WebSocket room signaling. Real on web; native Expo Go stays chat-only via graceful fallback.)

## Test Run — Phase 2: Unified Admin Dashboard with App Switcher (Main/Premium/Pro)

## Test Run — Premium Chat Theme + Premium Moment Comment Box Fix (Round 16)
user_problem_statement: (1) Premium app chat conversation must render in the Premium (royal-purple + gold) theme, not the main app theme. Messaging someone from Premium should open a premium-coloured chat. (2) In Premium moment detail, the comment/reply text box was collapsing into the device's bottom gesture bar — fix it (add bottom safe-area). (3) Verify reply flow shows the reply banner correctly.

## Test Run — User Feedback Round 7 (voice room HelloTalk-style redesign)
user_problem_statement: Voice room screen must match HelloTalk reference screenshot - (1) ONE uniform solid background colour (no two-tone gradient) with device status bar readable (light content); (2) announcements/official messages show a megaphone icon circle on the LEFT + dark bubble with "Notice" pill; (3) user chat messages show avatar WITH round flag + name + text inside dark pill bubble, host gets home chip; (4) hand-raise button stays on the RIGHT as rounded square; (5) "Comment..." pill input with circular dark icon buttons. FIX ROUND after first test: replaced LinearGradient with solid View bg (BG_COLORS), made chatSection transparent (was rgba overlay causing two-tone), added room-notice-icon testID, backend _room_card now returns title/topic/language for ENDED rooms so RoomMomentCard shows real title.

BROWSER TEST RESULTS: ❌ Could not fully verify - navigation issue prevented entering room screen (clicked 'Brand Polish Lounge' but remained on Voice Rooms list). Gradient detected at y=250 was from room LIST cards (expected), not room interior. No purple circles found because test didn't enter room. No ended room cards found in Moments feed.

## Test Run — User Feedback Round 6 (inline profile editing, voice bio, feed-style profile moments)

(2) Users can record a VOICE INTRODUCTION for their profile bio - record/play/re-record/delete in Edit Profile, playable bubble on profile preview.

RESULTS: ✅ Feed-style cards present (2 moment cards found) with avatar+name+VIP+flag+time header matching main Moments feed design. ✅ Like button works - clicked heart (profile-moment-like-), count incremented from 0 to 1. ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: Room card title incorrect. Expected 'Mandarin Practice Lounge' but shows 'ROOM ENDEDVoice room0 were in this room'. Room card (profile-moment-room-card-) is present but displays ended room text instead of live room title. This suggests RoomMomentCard component is not rendering room title correctly when room is ended, or moment is referencing wrong room data.

RESULT: ❌ No ended room cards found in Moments feed (0 cards detected). Could not verify if 'Mandarin Practice Lounge' title displays correctly.

(c) Test by creating a new room, sharing to moments, ending it, then checking Moments feed."

      message: "Quick re-verification of 3 fixes in the LinguaConnect Expo web app at https://voice-room-connect-2.preview.emergentagent.com (mobile viewport 390x844). EXECUTE the browser tests — do not stop after reading files. Login: welcome → 'I already have an account' → mei@demo.com / Demo1234! → 'Log In'. Close any 'Day X Streak!' modal via 'Awesome!' if it appears. FIX 1 — Voice room uniform background (frontend/app/room/[id].tsx): Voice tab (testid tab-voice) → open live room 'Brand Polish Lounge'. VERIFY the entire screen background is ONE solid colour (#413389): the stage/member area and the chat area must have the SAME background — previously the chat section had a darker overlay (rgba(0,0,0,0.18)); that overlay must be gone. The room now renders in a plain View (no LinearGradient element). Sample pixel colours at e.g. y=250 (stage area) and y=600 (chat area) at x=195 — they must match. FIX 2 — Notice megaphone icon (frontend/app/room/[id].tsx): In the same room, VERIFY testid room-notice-icon exists (purple circle with megaphone) to the LEFT of the dark Notice bubble containing the 'Notice' pill. Also the system message 'Welcome Mei Lin to the room!' should have the same megaphone circle on its left. FIX 3 — Ended room card shows real title (backend/routes/moments.py + RoomMomentCard): Go back, open Moments tab (testid tab-moments). Find the room-share moment card. VERIFY it shows the actual room title 'Mandarin Practice Lounge' with a 'ROOM ENDED' badge (grey card) — it must NOT say just 'Voice room'. Also open Mei's profile Moments tab (Me tab → tap the profile header row → Edit Profile → Preview → Moments tab, or navigate via Connect card): verify the same card shows 'Mandarin Practice Lounge' there too (testid starting profile-moment-room-card-). If navigation is hard, verifying it on the main Moments feed is sufficient plus the profile if reachable. Report pass/fail per fix with screenshots and console errors; update test_result.md."
    - agent: "testing"
      message: "RE-VERIFICATION COMPLETED (mobile 390x844, mei@demo.com). CODE REVIEW SHOWS ALL 3 FIXES CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED: ✅ FIX 1 - room/[id].tsx uses solid BG_COLORS with View backgroundColor (NOT LinearGradient), chatSection transparent. ✅ FIX 2 - megaphone icon with testID 'room-notice-icon' in purple circle, positioned LEFT of Notice bubble. ✅ FIX 3 - backend _room_card returns title/topic/language for ended rooms, RoomMomentCard displays room.title. BROWSER TEST RESULTS: ❌ NAVIGATION ISSUE - Could not enter 'Brand Polish Lounge' room (clicked but remained on Voice Rooms list). Gradient detected was from room LIST cards (expected), not room interior. No purple circles found because test didn't enter room. No ended room cards found in Moments feed (0 detected). CONCLUSION: All 3 fixes appear CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED in code but browser automation could not fully verify due to navigation/timing issues preventing room entry. STUCK TASKS: Both voice room redesign and profile moments tasks now marked as stuck (stuck_count: 2). RECOMMENDATION: Main agent should (1) Manually verify fixes work by opening app, (2) Check if 'Brand Polish Lounge' room is joinable, (3) Verify mei@demo.com has seeded ended room moment in DB for 'Mandarin Practice Lounge', (4) Consider if room navigation requires different interaction (long press, specific gesture, etc.)."


## Test Run — User Feedback Round 5 (visitors box with avatar stack + admin dashboard verification)

## Test Run — Voice Room Exit Drawer + Persistent Minimize + Host Transfer
user_problem_statement: New voice-room controls. Three-dot opens a right drawer (Recommended rooms + Share/Minimize/Power icons). Share icon -> submenu (Share to Chat / Share to Moments). Power icon -> bottom action sheet (Share / Minimize the room / Leave / Close[host only] / Cancel). Host Leave requires promoting an audience member to host first (room stays live). Close ends room. Minimize collapses to a floating bubble at root with audio persisting; tapping reopens the room.

## Test Run — Chat Reactions + Room Share Card + Voice Room Polish (Round 12)
user_problem_statement: (1) Chat: long-press message shows Instagram/HelloTalk-style reaction popup with 7 quick emojis + expandable full grid + context menu (Reply/Copy/Translate/Correct/Delete). Reactions displayed as badges under bubbles. (2) Voice room: audience switcher (3-dot) panel was too WIDE - now narrower (70%, max 320). (3) Voice room: switcher top icons redesigned (purple Share, transparent Minimize, red Power) - prettier. (4) Voice room: Share option sends room card directly to Chat or Moments. Chat share now sends a RoomMomentCard (host avatar + name + title + language + LIVE badge + Join button) instead of plain text.

TEST 4 - Future date ✅: birthday='2030-01-01' correctly rejected with 400 and 'Age must be between 13 and 120.' TEST 5 - Age lock ✅: First PUT with birthday='2000-05-15' sets age=26. Second PUT with birthday='1990-01-01' returns 200 but silently ignores change. GET /api/auth/me confirms birthday still '2000-05-15' and age still 26. Lock working correctly. TEST 6 - Backward compat ✅: PUT with only {bio:'hello there'} returns 200, bio updated correctly, no errors. TEST 7 - Direct age ✅: PUT with {age:30, gender:'female'} (no birthday) returns 200, age=30. Direct age setting still works when birthday not set. No critical issues found. All validation, age derivation, and locking logic working perfectly. Ready for main agent to summarize and finish."

## Test Run — Guest Mode + Icon Consistency + Parallax Profile (Round 14)
user_problem_statement: (1) Add "Guest Mode" button on welcome/signup page — bypass signup/login and enter the app directly. (2) All back icons in the app should be consistent (branding) — same style everywhere. (3) On profile page, cover image should stay FIXED while content scrolls over it (parallax-style).

## Fix (Round 14b) — Preview URL 404 resolved
- Root cause: /app/frontend/.env had a stale/incorrect EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL (voxdust-vip.preview.emergentagent.com). That domain resolves to emergent.sh marketing site, not this app's ingress → /api/* returned 404.
- Fix: Set EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL / EXPO_PACKAGER_PROXY_URL / EXPO_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME to the actual preview endpoint: 23e89f0c-4dcc-40fe-82d2-2e242a0a0207.preview.emergentagent.com (from env var `preview_endpoint`).
- Verified: curl to /api/ returns 200 {"message":"LinguaConnect API"}. Guest mode button now logs in and lands at Connect page with streak popup + 515 coins.

## Test Run — Share Flow Redesign + Narrower Switcher Panel (Round 15)
user_problem_statement: (1) Voice room 3-dot switcher panel still too wide — make narrower and distribute the top icons evenly (space-around) instead of bunched to one side. (2) Both host AND audience can Share to Chat / Share to Moments (audience wasn't allowed before). (3) Share to Moments opens a full-page composer (like a normal moment post) with the room card as attachment + a caption TextInput on top. (4) Share to Chat opens a full NEW page listing all chat contacts, tap a contact to send the card. (5) Room card in chat is the FULL size (same as Moments card), not compact.

## Test Run — Room Share Card matches Voice-Tab Card + Announcement + Full Compose page (Round 16)
user_problem_statement: (1) Room-share card in moments/chat should look EXACTLY like the voice-tab list card (same gradient, LIVE bars, host row, member stack, topic + language badges). (2) When user creates a moment (create FAB), open full-page composer with photo first, then text, then TAG chips (suggested + custom). (3) Room creation should have an announcement field + prettier design. (4) 3-dot switcher panel background should be a deeper shade of the room's own background color, NOT pitch black.

## Test Run — Moment Compose Redesign + Poll + Chat card equal size (Round 17)
user_problem_statement: (1) Chat share room card should be same size as moments room card (full width). (2) Moment compose page redesigned — text first, tags hidden in a bottom sheet (list form) available via tag icon, photo added via bottom action bar (+ icon), poll creation and other functionality added, much prettier design.

RECOMMENDATION: Main agent must fix auth token persistence/expiration issues OR manually verify UI by creating room through app and confirming: audience section visible with 0 listeners + empty placeholder, right rail below audience row (no overlap), host has mic button (no VIP tile), audience has VIP tile (no mic button)."

          comment: "Previously auth.tsx did router.replace('/'), which after the Round-24 vault change dropped users back on the calculator. Fixed: AuthContext.login/register/guestLogin now return the resolved User; auth.tsx and welcome.tsx read that user and route directly to /(tabs)/connect (or /onboarding if native/learning language is missing). Verified via screenshot: (a) Vault 11+37= → /welcome, then login as mei@demo.com/Demo1234! → /connect (Day-1 streak modal visible). (b) Continue as Guest on /welcome → /connect. No Apple sign-in exists in the codebase — user's mention of 'Apple login' was interpreted as 'all social/alt auth paths'; only Guest + email/password login+signup exist and all three are fixed. Also recreated missing /app/backend/.env and /app/frontend/.env (MONGO_URL / DB_NAME / JWT_SECRET / EMERGENT_LLM_KEY / CORS_ORIGINS / ADMIN_PASSWORD; EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL and packager env vars) and re-seeded the 9 demo users so login works again."

Highlight pill above the card renders the pressed message at its original position: text messages use a lilac pill with purple corner dots (multi-line, auto-shrink font down to fs=12 for very long text, up to 12 lines); voice messages render a HelloTalk-style pill (play triangle + duration read from item.duration_ms) plus a small circular mic-with-A affordance to its right. Position math clamps pill+card inside TOP_SAFE(60) and BOTTOM_SAFE(40); if the natural stack won't fit, everything gets shifted upward. Voice-only rows (Transcription, Share) and mine-only rows (Recall) render conditionally. Card height is computed from the actual visible row count so heights fit exactly."

Rail will never ride into stage/audience rows with this positioning. ⚠️ TEST 2 (Mute Badge) NEEDS VISUAL VERIFICATION - Mic button [data-testid='room-bar-mic-btn'] clicked successfully to mute/unmute, but HTML string inspection did NOT detect 'mic-off' in stage member HTML when muted.

TESTS NOT COMPLETED: ❌ TEST 4-7 NOT TESTED - Unable to complete Context B (diego@demo.com joining room) and member sheet tests (user view & host view) due to multi-context authentication complexity and time constraints.

CRITICAL FINDINGS: Rail positioning is CORRECT and meets all requirements (below audience row, 60-85% viewport height). Mute badge code is present and should work, but needs visual verification from screenshots to confirm the badge actually renders when mic is muted. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent should: (1) Visually inspect screenshot test2_after_mute.png to confirm if small mic-off badge appears on host's stage avatar when muted (should be small icon overlay on avatar), (2) If badge is NOT visible in screenshot, investigate why member.mic_on state is not updating correctly after POST /api/rooms/{id}/mic or why badge View is not rendering despite code being present, (3) Manually test Context B flow with diego@demo.com to verify member sheet interactions work correctly for both user and host views."

## Round 47 — Sticker alignment bug fix verification (re-test)
user_problem_statement: Verify a sticker-alignment bug fix at http://localhost:3000 (Expo web, viewport 390x844).

The chat contains sticker messages sent by MEI (self). Sticker messages are Pressable elements containing an Image ~120px wide loaded from googlefonts noto emoji URLs (fonts.gstatic.com noto-emoji) — find images whose src contains "noto" or "gstatic", excluding avatars. VERIFY: (1) The LAST (bottom-most) sticker image — sent by mei — is RIGHT-aligned: its bounding-box center-x > 55% of the 390px viewport (measure and report exact px/%). Previously these rendered on the LEFT (~25%), which was the bug. (2) Also confirm regular self text bubbles are right-aligned (sanity, e.g. "hello" style bubble or the call card with text "Call" — center-x > 55%). (3) Screenshot the chat. Report pass/fail per point with measured positions.

Measurements: Y position: 594.0px (lowest on screen), Left edge: 254.0px, Width: 120.0px, Center-x: 314.0px (80.5% of 390px viewport). Required threshold: center-x > 55% (> 214.5px). Actual: 80.5% (314.0px) > 55% threshold. ✅ PASS: Sticker is right-aligned as expected for self-sent messages. Previous bug showed stickers at ~25% (left-aligned), now correctly at 80.5% (right-aligned). VERIFICATION 2 - TEXT BUBBLE ALIGNMENT (SANITY CHECK): ✅ PASS. Regular self-sent text bubbles are correctly RIGHT-ALIGNED. Found multiple text elements: 'Test message for regression test' at center-x 245.1px (62.9% > 55%) ✅, 'Voice Call' card at center-x 266.0px (68.2% > 55%) ✅. All self-sent text bubbles exceed the 55% threshold, confirming consistent right-alignment for self-sent messages. VERIFICATION 3 - SCREENSHOT: ✅ PASS. Screenshots saved: diego_chat_initial.png, diego_chat_sticker_verification.png, final_verification.png. All screenshots show the sticker (😂 emoji) positioned on the right side of the chat, aligned with other self-sent messages (text bubbles, voice call card). NO CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND. The sticker alignment bug fix is WORKING CORRECTLY. Self-sent stickers are now properly right-aligned (80.5%) instead of left-aligned (~25% in the previous bug). The code at line 1524 in /app/frontend/app/chat/[id].tsx correctly uses alignSelf: mine ? 'flex-end' : 'flex-start' for sticker Pressable elements. Bug fix verified successfully."
